# Hope-Speech-Detection

Hope is considered significant for the well-being, recuperation and restoration of human
life by health professionals. Psychologists, sociologists and social workers in the
Association of Hope have concluded that hope can also be a useful tool for saving people
from suicide or harming themselves.
Hope speech reflects the belief that one can discover pathways to their desired objectives
and become roused to utilize those pathways. I performed an experiment on Hope Speech
dataset for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion.
